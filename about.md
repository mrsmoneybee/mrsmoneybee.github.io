Hello there! I am Mrs Money Bee. I am a wife, mother of 2, and a stay at home mother. I am a former high school math teacher. It was while teaching that I decided that if I could teach my ideal class it would be a very basic financial literacy course. So many of my students did not seem to have much (or any) experience in financial topics and I so wished I could delve into that with them but alas, I had other topics I was required to teach them. This is my attempt to give others some content that will help them in their financial future. 
I was raised in a house with two parents that were financially savvy. I was very lucky to have that upbringing since it gave me so much experience in being what I would consider “financially wise”. This is something I hope to instill in my own children.
