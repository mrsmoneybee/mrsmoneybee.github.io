# Building a Budget
What I would consider to be the most important part of being financially wise would be building a budget. <!--more--> I know what you’re thinking, “ugh, another person telling me to budget. Enough already!” But it’s so true. It is so important to have an understanding of how much you are spending versus how much you are bringing home. Ideally, you would be spending less than you are bringing home. To build a very basic budget you can use mint.com or any number of similar sites. Our family uses mint.com and it is a great site to use to break down where your money goes.

To start your budget, write down how much you make each month. You could also use your weekly or biweekly income, just make sure you take note of the timeframe you are using for tracking your income. We have found using our monthly income is easiest since then we only have to track expenditures monthly instead of weekly or biweekly. I will build a sample along with you.

INCOME (MONTHLY):

Work 1: $1,500

TOTAL INCOME: $1,500

The total income for this person is $1,500 per month.

Then write down the expenditures you cannot live without. For example, rent or mortgage, groceries, gas or other transportation costs (including any car payments), utilities, etc. Luxuries would not be written down here. Break those down into the same time frame that you used for your income. If you used monthly income, use monthly expenditures etc.

EXPENDITURES (MONTHLY):

Rent/Mortgage: $750

Groceries: $250

Gas/transportation: $100

Utilities: $100

TOTAL EXPENDITURES: $1,200

You can see here I added up all of the non-negotiable expenditures to reach my total expenditures of $1,200. INCOME – EXPENDITURES leaves me with $300 per month excess.

Now, in order for you to be able to stick with your budget I think it is important that you leave yourself some flexibility to spend money on things that are not necessary such as dining out, entertainment, etc. But I also think it is important to have a budget on these things so that you are not constantly running a deficit because you aren’t paying attention to how much you are spending.

OTHER EXPENDITURES (MONTHLY):

Shopping: $50

Dining out: $50

Entertainment: $50

TOTAL OTHER EXPENDITURES: $150

Adding EXPENDITURES + OTHER EXPENDITURES gives me TOTAL EXPENDITURES of $1,350 per month. Then to figure out how much you have left over each month take INCOME – TOTAL EXPENDITURES which leaves me with $150 per month excess.

If you get to this point and you see that you have a negative balance, you should try to shift the spending down on some categories to try to get to a positive balance or else you will not be able to sustain your lifestyle for very long… Unless you happen to find some extra income to cover that deficit.

When you see a positive balance you will probably be tempted to tweak the spending on some categories up. My advice, try to keep them as they are. After a few months of being on this budget you may realize that $100 for gas isn’t nearly enough or that your utilities have seen an unexpected uptick. This will give you more buffer so that those things that you have to change won’t cause you to go into a deficit each month. Instead, take that excess and put it into a savings account so that it will accumulate to make you more money in the future. The younger you start to save, the more wealth you will have as you get older.

After a few months, re-evaluate your budget. See if your limits were realistic or not. If they weren’t, modify your budget to take that into account. Remember to try to keep a positive balance in the end. If you are spending less than your budget give yourself a giant pat on the back! (Especially if you’ve been putting your excess into your savings account. ;) )
