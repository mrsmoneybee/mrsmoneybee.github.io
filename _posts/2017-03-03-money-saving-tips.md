I thought I'd share just a few ideas I have that can save you some money without making drastic lifestyle changes. <!--more-->

# Learn to cook at home. 
Eating out is expensive. My husband told me about a fifteen dollar hamburger he ordered the other day! I could make that for $5 or less! I will admit it is fun to go out and not have to worry about cooking AND cleaning the MOUNTAIN of dishes. I’ve started cooking a lot more often and honestly, I can’t even think of somewhere I would want to go eat. I was feeling incredibly lazy just the other day and told my husband I wanted to go out but then I started thinking, where? I could not think of a single place that served something I truly wanted to eat. Luckily we had plenty of leftovers from meals I had cooked previously in the week. It can also save you money on lunches. My husband takes leftovers to work most days, other than the $15 hamburger day.

# Don’t buy things you don’t really need.
It’s fun to go out and buy new things. I’ll admit, even I get a rush of excitement buying new things. This one is just as much a reminder to me as a tip to you. Before I go on a shopping spree I ask myself (hopefully…) is this something that will drastically improve my quality of life or save me time or save me money? If I can’t answer yes to any of those I really try not to buy whatever it is I’m looking at. With the exception of necessities (toilet paper, toothpaste, clothing, etc) if it’s not going to be something life-changing I don’t want to buy it. In a few days it will just become something else taking up space in my already crowded home.

# Shop at second hand stores (or facebook groups, craigslist, yard sales, etc.)
This is my current biggest struggle. I have really wanted to find a way to save money on clothing. There is some part of me that does not want to go to Goodwill and stores like it just because of experiences I’ve had in the past with terrible selection and torn up clothing. I shop for most of the clothes for my family at Wal-mart and Target. That saves us some money as opposed to shopping at the mall. I keep an eye out on Facebook groups but for some reason I must have terrible timing or my family wears the most popular size clothing because I normally can’t find anything in our size ranges. Anyone else have any ideas for me? Or do I need to give Goodwill a second (more like fiftieth…) chance? I guess I have no good advice here…

# Shop at wholesale clubs
This is something we’ve done for a while now. This may not be feasible in your area. I know where we used to live in the Southeast we
didn’t have a wholesale club within forty miles of our house. Now we have one down the street from us. It may also not be feasible if it’s just you or you have a small family. You do have to pay an annual fee, but with the amount of money many items save you (MILK!), it pays for the annual fee pretty easily. Not all items are cheaper here however, so it does help to shop around before you commit to buying everything here.

# For those in the family way
This section is specifically for those planning on having children at some point in the future. I know how tempting it is to register for tons of items (and expensive ones at that!) but I urge you to reconsider what you are going to register for. We have two children so I am not the most experienced in this way but I do feel as though people go way overboard buying things for their children. You do not need the most expensive car seat. I know that you’re probably thinking that the most expensive car seat is always better however, I will say that is not always the case. We bought one of the cheaper car seats (*gasp*!) and it served us extremely well. We ended up switching to a convertible car seat before too long. Those infant carriers get heavy with a child. Whoever thinks you can easily carry a nearly 
one-year-old in that thing without losing your arm must be a body builder (or at least 10 times stronger than me). Our children rode more comfortably in a convertible seat than the infant carrier so I was glad I didn’t spend a fortune on it. The only things I felt I truly needed after our first child was born were a car seat, a pack and play (the kids slept in our room for the first few months), diapers, clothing, burp cloths (YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH!!!), formula and bottles (if you are not breastfeeding) OR breast pump and bottles (if you are breastfeeding and planning to go back to work), and possibly pacifiers (our children never took to pacifiers). Other things I would consider as nice to have but definitely not necessities. I’m going to stop here but I might have to make an entire post dedicated to this because there’s so much I want to say without taking too much space here. But basically, don’t think you need everything right away. At first your kid is only going to eat, sleep, and poop so you won’t need all that much stuff right away.
